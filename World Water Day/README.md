## [HackerEarth Machine Learning challenge: World Water Day](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/new/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-world-water-day/)
The challenge was to develop a smart water monitoring system that leverages machine learning to predict household water consumption patterns.

This is my approach and solution to  **HackerEarth's** **[Machine Learning challenge: World Water Day](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/new/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-world-water-day/)**

This approach has helped me to get a RMSE score of **91.53** on the test set and I got ranked **1st** on the global public leaderboard at the end of the challenge.

Machine Learning algorithms used: **CatBoost Regressor**

-> **catboost_final.ipynb** is the notebook which contains my source code.

**Note**: I'm not adding the obvious EDA steps in the code as they can be easily seen from the `profiling_report.html`.
