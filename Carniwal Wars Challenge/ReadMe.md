## [Carniwal Wars Predict the Price Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/predict-the-price-5-fe7f8735/)

This is my approach and solution to  **HackerEarth's** **[Carniwal Wars Predict the Price Challenge](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/machine-learning/predict-the-price-5-fe7f8735/)**

This approach helped me to get a score of **90.24** and I was ranked **29th (out of 2300+ participants)** on the global leaderboard at the end of the contest.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
**1. Gradient Boost Regression**
**2. Random Forest Regression**
**3. XGBoost Regression**

I stacked these three regression models together to form an advanced regression model.

-> **Final_Price_Prediction.ipynb** is the notebook which contains my source code.
-> **BP.csv** is the output file of blended stacked regressors and is my final csv for price prediction.
-> **GBPredict.csv** is the price predicted using Gradient Boosting regression model.
-> **RFPredict.csv** is the price predicted using Random Forest regression model.
-> **XGPredict.csv** is the price predicted using XG Boost regression model.

**Note: BP.csv was used for final prediction output.**
