## [Power Plant Energy Prediction AI Challenge](https://dockship.io/challenges/5fa1f40ac2a4984b34ef0a66/power-plant-energy-prediction-ai-challenge/overview)

This is my approach and solution to  **Dockship's** **[Power Plant Energy Prediction AI Challenge](https://dockship.io/challenges/5fa1f40ac2a4984b34ef0a66/power-plant-energy-prediction-ai-challenge/overview)**

This approach has helped me to get a score of **2.712 (RMSE)** and I am currently ranked **2nd** on the global leaderboard the event is currently going on.

Machine Learning algorithms used:
**1. XGBoost Regression**
**2. Random Forest Regression**

I also stacked two regression models together to form an advanced regression model.

-> **Energy Prediction Challenge.ipynb** is the notebook which contains my source code.

-> **BP.csv** is the output file of blended stacked regressors and is my final csv for energy prediction.

-> **RFPredictions.csv** is the energy predicted using Random Forest regression model.

-> **XGBPredictions.csv** is the energy predicted using XG Boost regression model.

**Note: BP.csv was used for final prediction output.**
